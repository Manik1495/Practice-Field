How to deal with this??

1.  Print logo "Higher lower"
2.  Print "Compare A: Shawn Mendes, a Musician, from Canada."
    Store the Compare_A
    Here "Compare A" is constant and other values are retrived from data.
    data = [
    {
        'name': 'Instagram',
        'follower_count': 346,
        'description': 'Social media platform',
        'country': 'United States'
    },

    So 
    'name' = Shawn Mendes
    'description' = Musician
    'country' = Canada

    hence,
    Compare A: Shawn Mendes, a Musician, from Canada. --> Compare A: {'name':Shawn Mendes}, a {'description':'Musician'}, from {'country':'Canada'}

    How to randon generate these values??
    *************************************
    Define a function for random key-value generation from the list --> def random_nameGen()


3.  Print logo "VS"

4.  Print "Against B: NBA, a Club Basketball Competition, from United States." --> follow same as step 2.
    Store the Against_B.

5.  Input from user --> "Who has more followers? Type 'A' or 'B':"

6.  Define a function which calculates who has more followers. Return the result. --> def who_got_moreFollow()

7. If result is TRUE, print "Compare A" with value of "Against B:" --> Copy paste that thing
    Compare_A = Against_B
    Current_Score += 1
    Call the random_nameGen() and return the value into Against_B.

8. If the choice is wrong print logo and "Sorry, that's wrong. Final score: 1"


Now the question is how to continue
